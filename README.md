This repository contains the LaTeX source for the slides for my [Statistics for Travel Behavior class](). I hope you find them helpful. They are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license; please feel free to use them as you see fit, as long as they are attributed. And if you do use them, I'd love to hear about it! If you don't want to compile the LaTeX source, the [PDF slides are also available](https://files.indicatrix.org/teaching/stats.pdf).

Code to create the original images and analysis on the slides is in the `notebooks` folder. Some of these require the [CSV version of the 2017 NHTS](https://nhts.ornl.gov) or the [Mode choice in Switzerland example data from biogeme](http://biogeme.epfl.ch/data.html) to be available in the `data` folder.

These slides were created with support from the [Center for Teaching Old Models New Tricks](https://tomnet-utc.engineering.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu), a University Transportation Center funded by the [United States Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/).
