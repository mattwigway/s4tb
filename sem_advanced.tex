\begin{frame}{Latent and observed variables}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Structural equation models consist of \emph{latent} and \emph{observed} variables
    \item An observed variable is one that come from outside the model---like a survey question
    \item A latent variable is a variable that is determined inside the model---like an attitudinal factor
    \item Every model has observed variables, some don't have latent variables
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exogenous and endogenous variables}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item An \emph{exogenous} variable is one that is not influenced by any other variable in the model
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{i.e.} no arrows pointing to the variable
    \end{itemize}
    \item An \emph{endogenous} variable is a variable that is influenced by at least one other variable in the model
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{i.e.} at least one arrow pointing to the variable
      \item there may or may not be arrows pointing away from the variable
    \end{itemize}
    \item All SEMs have at least one endogenous variable, almost all have exogenous variables
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Latent and observed vs. endogenous and exogenous variables}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Latent and observed have nothing to do with endogenous or exogenous
    \item All of these types of variables are possible
    \begin{itemize}
      \item observed, endogenous
      \item latent, endogenous
      \item observed, exogenous
      \item latent, exogenous
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and SEMs}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Exploratory factor analysis is a separate method from SEMs
    \item Confirmatory factor analysis can be (and usually is) \emph{part of} the SEM
    \item Most authors use an exploratory factor analysis to identify the structure before using a confirmatory factor analysis in their SEM

    \item If factors are found with an exploratory factor analysis, there are calculated before the SEM is fit
    \item Thus, from the perspective of the SEM, these are \emph{observed} variables
